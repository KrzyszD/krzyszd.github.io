                Hack club is an organization located in San Francisco <br>
                Their main focus is to introduce students to programming <br>
                This is a branch of that organization here at SHS founded by Stephan An, Vivek Bhatt and myself <br>
                <br> <br>
                To answer the obvious question <br>
                This isn't a club for hacking computer systems or networks<br>
                This is an extra opportunity to learn how to program outside fo class
